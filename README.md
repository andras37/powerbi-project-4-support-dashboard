# Customer Support Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how a Business Analyst can use Power BI to support
data-driven decision-making by analyzing customer support performance.

The focus of the project is not advanced BI development, but **clear business
questions, well-defined KPIs, and stakeholder-oriented insights**.

## Business Objective
The goal of this dashboard is to help stakeholders:
- Understand overall support workload
- Monitor SLA compliance
- Identify bottlenecks in ticket resolution
- Track performance trends over time

---

## Key Business Questions
- How many tickets are handled over time?
- What is the average resolution time?
- Where do SLA breaches occur most frequently?
- Which categories or priorities create the highest workload?
- Is support performance improving or declining?

---

## Key KPIs
- **Total Tickets**
- **Average Resolution Time**
- **SLA Compliance Rate (%)**
- **Open vs Closed Tickets**
- **Tickets by Priority and Category**
